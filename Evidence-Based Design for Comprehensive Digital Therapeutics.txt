Evidence-Based Design for Comprehensive Digital Therapeutics
The research reveals a critical gap: no validated digital therapeutics exist for the complex comorbid presentation you've described. However, extensive evidence from 2020-2025 provides clear architectural principles and design recommendations. The most important finding: transdiagnostic approaches addressing multiple conditions simultaneously show superior outcomes (effect size g=0.54-0.80) compared to sequential treatment, ADDitude +3 but only when using modular, adaptive architectures that manage cognitive load for users with executive dysfunction. PubMed Central
Why this matters: Your user's presentation—ADHD, major depression, complex PTSD, severe physical deconditioning, social anxiety, BDD, codependency, academic failure, and profound self-alienation—mirrors real-world complexity systematically excluded from clinical trials. Current validated apps test "clean" single-diagnosis populations with strict exclusion criteria. PubMed Central Building for this complexity requires synthesizing evidence across multiple domains while acknowledging you're pioneering territory without direct precedent.
What works: Modular architectures within integrated data infrastructure, adaptive AI personalization, cognitive load optimization, simultaneous multi-domain intervention, embedded learning (teaching while doing), and hybrid human-AI support. What doesn't: Predetermined pathways, single-task-per-day limitations, separate learning modules, fully autonomous AI for severe cases, and wellness apps masquerading as clinical interventions.
Validated frameworks for complex comorbid presentations
Research from 2020-2025 identifies four frameworks specifically validated for multiple simultaneous conditions:
Stepped Care 2.0 provides the strongest evidence base. Wellrootscounseling A 2024 umbrella review found depression response rates 52% higher at 3-6 months and 47% higher at 9-12 months compared to standard care, with maintained effects for anxiety APAServices (SMD=-0.29). ScienceDirect The framework emphasizes client-driven intensity adjustment—71% of participants in a 2024 RCT required intensity changes during treatment. JMIR Mental Health This flexibility proves essential for users whose functioning varies dramatically day-to-day. Implementation requires low-intensity self-guided components, medium-intensity coached elements, and high-intensity human support with seamless transitions based on real-time need. PubMed Central
The Unified Protocol (Barlow's transdiagnostic CBT framework) shows large effect sizes when digitized: g=0.84 for depression and g=0.78 for anxiety in web-based formats. Cambridge Core A 2023 systematic review of 53 studies (6,705 participants) confirmed effects across individual, group, and internet-based delivery. Nature The protocol targets shared mechanisms—emotion dysregulation, avoidance, cognitive inflexibility— Oxford Academicmaking it ideal for comorbid presentations where treating one disorder in isolation risks worsening others through the "whack-a-mole effect." PubMed Central
MATCH-ADTC (Modular Approach to Therapy) offers 33 flexible modules across anxiety, depression, trauma, and conduct problems. Critical feature: therapists can address multiple problem areas within single sessions and use procedures earlier than standard protocols indicate. Ojp This flexibility outperforms both standard manualized treatment and usual care. CEBC The modular approach allows users to focus on the most pressing symptom while maintaining comprehensive framework coverage. ScienceDirect
Transdiagnostic Staging Framework (Wade et al., 2025) identifies 38 shared psychological processes across depression, anxiety, and eating disorders. Sage JournalsPubMed Central The six-stage model (0=at-risk to 4=severe/complex) enables early intervention before full-threshold disorders emerge and prevents progression. Sage JournalsPubMed Central For your Stage 4 user (severe/complex with multiple disorders), this framework validates targeting shared vulnerability factors rather than treating each diagnosis sequentially.
A 2025 meta-analysis of transdiagnostic apps (19 RCTs, 5,165 participants) confirmed small but significant effects (g=0.29, 95% CI 0.17-0.40), comparable to disorder-specific approaches. PubMed Critical insight: Simultaneous treatment isn't just acceptable—it's more effective. The shared mechanisms mean treating one condition improves others, reducing total treatment time and preventing symptom migration.
Cognitive load management for severe executive dysfunction
The research overwhelmingly supports specific architectural decisions for ADHD populations. Single-task focus wins decisively. A study on multiple task interference (PMC3313619) found ADHD individuals show significantly greater difficulty with simultaneous multitasking. Task switching incurs higher "cognitive cost" in ADHD brains. Present one primary task at a time with clear completion criteria.
Chunking protocol: Break tasks into units completable in under one hour. Each chunk needs clear start/end points, progress indicators ("Step 2 of 5"), save/bookmark capability between chunks, and micro-rewards celebrating completion. CareClinic +2 Progressive disclosure—revealing next elements only after completing prior steps—prevents overwhelm from seeing full complexity upfront. ADDitudeLife Skills Advocate Each "next" click provides dopamine boost through sense of progress. Intuit Design HubEndeavorOTC
Timing specifications: Never force time limits. Users control pace entirely. Suggest 25-30 minute work blocks with 5-minute breaks (Pomodoro-style) but allow pause/resume at any point. LearningWorks for Kids +2 A 2023 Frontiers in Psychiatry study of ADHD digital therapeutics found 15-minute daily sessions for 4 weeks showed significant improvements when paired with adaptive difficulty adjustment. ADDitude +2 Longer sessions risk overwhelming; shorter sessions lack therapeutic depth.
Working memory support: Apps must minimize recall demands through persistent display of key information, auto-complete suggestions, redundant information (never asking users to remember from previous screens), visual mnemonics (icons paired with text), and saved states preventing lost progress during distraction. LearningWorks for Kids Recognition beats recall—use multiple choice over open-ended whenever possible. EndeavorOTC Research on working memory training shows the central executive (domain-general mechanisms) matters more than specific subcomponents, so support should be comprehensive rather than targeted. LearningWorks for KidsFrontiers
Notification architecture: Implement three-tier system. Critical only (default): Time-sensitive, actionable items with sound + vibration + badge—medication reminders, appointments within 15 minutes. Scheduled summary: Batch non-urgent notifications 2-3 times daily at user-selected times for task completions, achievements, social updates. Silent/badge only: Informational updates like new content available, visible when checking app but non-interruptive. Medium User control proves essential—ADHD users often disable ALL notifications when overwhelmed, losing benefits of actually important reminders. Granular control for each notification type, quiet hours during focus periods, and notification preview before enabling maximize utility while preventing overwhelm. Focus Bear
The 106-154 day challenge: General population forms habits in 66 days average (18-254 day range). ADHD populations require 106-154 days (3-5 months)—significantly longer per 2024 ADDA research. Habit formation may start around 2 months but takes much longer to solidify. ADDA This fundamentally changes app architecture—interventions must sustain engagement and provide external scaffolding for 3-5 months minimum, not the 6-12 week periods most digital therapeutics test. Variability is high; some habits form in weeks, others require much longer. ADDA Success requires stable specific cues (same time, same place daily), impossible-to-miss environmental cues, immediate rewards (not delayed benefits), habit stacking (anchoring to existing routines), and gamification through visual chains and progress tracking. ADDA +2
Physical rehabilitation integration with mental health treatment
For someone bedridden for extended periods with 6-year deconditioning and fear of exercise, the sequence matters critically. Evidence supports simultaneous intervention with phased emphasis, not mental-first or physical-first exclusively.
Weeks 1-2: Assessment and stabilization phase. Behavioral activation sessions 1-2 introduce activity monitoring and psychoeducation on the depression-inactivity cycle. PubMed Central +2 Functional capacity testing (2-minute walk test, sit-to-stand) and medical clearance occur simultaneously. Physical activity remains at current level (observation only) while daily logging tracks activities, mood (0-10 scale), and physical symptoms. This establishes baseline without demanding change when user is most vulnerable.
Weeks 3-4: Minimal activation phase. Behavioral activation sessions 3-4 address values clarification and meaningful activities. PubMed CentralPsychology Tools Introduce one 5-minute gentle activity daily—seated exercises, standing tolerance practice, or slow walking. Frequency matters more than duration: 5-7 days/week at same duration. Progress only after 80% completion rate achieved. A Chinese longitudinal study (2025, Nature Scientific Reports) found physical exercise negatively impacted depression (β=-0.024, p<0.05) but critically, depression's impact on reducing activity proved stronger over time (β=-0.068 to -0.082). PubMed This bidirectional relationship means external structure can't rely on internal motivation—the app must provide scaffolding.
Weeks 5-8: Progressive overload with modified protocol. Standard progressive overload assumes baseline functional capacity. For severe deconditioning, volume increases before intensity. Wikipedia Week 5: 5 minutes 2x daily (frequency increase). Week 6: 7 minutes 2x daily (duration increase). Week 7-8: 7-10 minutes 2x daily with introduction of gentle resistance (bodyweight squats to chair, wall pushups). Studies on hospital-associated deconditioning show patients exercising 5 days/week, 30 minutes/day for 24 weeks showed no fitness improvement if underlying disease present (PACE trial). Interpretation: consistency and appropriateness matter more than progression rate.
"10 seconds of standing" validation: While no studies specifically test 10-second starting points, graduated exposure protocol from kinesiophobia treatment validates ultra-small initial exposures. Start with safe range of movement patient can tolerate without flare-up. Progress only when client demonstrates readiness subjectively and objectively. Rehabilityjournal Success experiences prove critical—every completed movement without negative consequence reduces fear. Specialised Health For someone with 6 years of fear and trauma around exercise, starting below current capacity builds confidence essential for sustained engagement.
Kinesiophobia treatment protocol (2023 Delphi consensus): Phase 1: Motivational interviewing exploring discrepancy between values and current avoidance. Phase 2: Pain neuroscience education explaining movement doesn't equal tissue damage. Phase 3: Graded exposure creating hierarchy of feared movements (0-10 fear rating), starting with 3-4/10 fear level, performing repeatedly until fear habituation (<2/10). Rehabilityjournal This typically requires 8-12 weeks before aggressive reconditioning begins. Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia (TSK score >37) indicates need for fear-focused intervention before fitness-focused progression. Rehabilityjournal
Integration model: Collaborative care. A 2020 International Journal of Mental Health Systems review found treating physical and mental health concurrently addresses mind-body interactions more effectively than sequential approaches. Springer +2 Physical deconditioning worsens depression; depression worsens deconditioning—breaking one link proves insufficient. Specialised HealthMedical News Today Track both mood AND physical metrics daily in unified interface. Celebrate physical progress while acknowledging when mood affects physical adherence. Algorithms must adjust physical goals based on reported mood/energy. Mental health deterioration triggers human intervention, not purely algorithmic response.
Task structure for severe depression with anhedonia
The evidence strongly favors micro-tasks with specific parameters. Banyan Mental Health A 2025 JMIR systematic review (17 RCTs, published June 2025) found digital behavioral activation effective at 2 months (P<.001), 3 months (P=.001), and 6 months (P=.009) but showed no sustained benefits at 12 months (P=.82). PubMed +4 This highlights the need for sustained engagement strategies, not just initial effectiveness.
Standard BA protocol structure (COBRA/UK studies): Sessions 1-2 focus on self-monitoring with hourly activity and mood ratings (0-10). Sessions 3-4 clarify values and identify "UP" activities (increase pleasure/mastery). Sessions 5+ involve graded activity scheduling starting with simpler tasks. PubMed CentralNCBI Duration typically spans 8-20 sessions over 6-12 weeks. Critical finding from Psychology Tools BA Guidelines: For severe depression with anhedonia, start with absolute basics—"Make sure to include targets like washing and brushing your teeth every day, doing laundry every week, cooking meals, shopping." Psychology Tools The hourly activity scheduling uses 1-hour blocks, one activity per hour, Positive Psychology with the 80-100% success rule: progress only when current task mastered at this rate.
Daily structure template for severe presentation:
Morning (upon waking): ONE basic self-care task (shower OR breakfast OR medication—not all three initially). 5-minute gentle movement (stretching in bed OR standing by window). Mood rating (0-10).
Midday: ONE functional task (respond to one email OR wash dishes OR short walk—not multiple). Mood rating.
Afternoon: ONE pleasurable/meaningful micro-activity (10-minute hobby, call friend, sit outside—under 15 minutes). 5-minute physical activity if morning activity completed. Mood rating.
Evening: ONE self-care task (prepare tomorrow's clothes OR evening hygiene). Mood rating. Log: What worked, what was difficult, tomorrow's plan.
Weekly review identifies 2-3 activities associated with highest mood ratings, plans to repeat those plus add ONE new similar activity, and problem-solves biggest barrier from past week.
Why this works: The Moodivate app (2025, JAMA Internal Medicine) showed BDI-II scores dropped 10.3 points versus 5.94 for usual care, with users 2x more likely to achieve remission. However, engagement dropped from 100% week 1 to 33% by week 12, highlighting adherence challenges. PsychnewsAPAServices A smartphone CBT study (2020, PMC) found behavioral activation sessions contributed most significantly to depression reduction, with self-monitoring alone providing therapeutic benefit before adding activities. The first half of behavioral activation sessions showed strongest predictive value for overall improvement. PubMed Central
Motivation systems for depression—distinct from healthy populations: Depression involves blunted phasic striatal dopamine signaling creating reduced reward anticipation (ventral striatum hypoactivation), impaired reward learning, and effort-reward dissociation. Dovepress Anhedonia affects 70% of MDD patients. PubMed +3 What fails: "Just get motivated" approaches, large reward systems requiring sustained high effort, delayed gratification without interim reinforcement, competitive/social comparison motivators. What works: Anticipatory pleasure enhancement through visualization and concrete planning, immediate reinforcement through mood-activity connection tracking, reducing effort perception via graded exposure and environmental modification, values-based (not goal-based) activation reducing performance pressure while maintaining meaning.

Relationship management and learning design for processing deficits
The research reveals a critical gap: zero evidence-based digital tools exist specifically for codependent relationship patterns, despite extensive theoretical foundations. This represents a major opportunity for innovation but requires building without direct precedent.
Emerging AI-powered solutions show promise. GaslightingCheck.com (2024+) offers text and audio analysis for manipulation patterns including distorting reality, blame-shifting, guilt-tripping, and contradictory statements. Voice analysis captures tone variations, speech patterns, and emotional markers. MDPI Privacy-focused architecture uses end-to-end encryption with automatic data deletion. Evidence shows 3 in 5 people experience gaslighting, spending approximately 2 years before recognition. MDPI UNDERCOVER app provides AI-powered detection of insults/profanities with 20+ classifications, automatic emergency alerts to trusted contacts, and incident recording for documentation. However, these tools lack rigorous validation—they're emerging technology without RCT support.
Attachment-informed design principles from 2022 comprehensive review (PMC9256980) provide evidence-based framework. Digital therapeutic alliance (DTA) differs from face-to-face in three ways: bond component remains unclear (some users reject relationships with apps while others report human-level bonds), human empathy proves difficult to replicate despite mimicry attempts, and unique advantages include non-judgmental experience, flexibility in time/location/duration, and reduced stigma. FrontiersPubMed Central Persuasive technology features that increase engagement: primary task support (reduction, tunneling, tailoring, self-monitoring), dialogue support (reminders, rewards, praise, feedback—apps with reminders show significantly lower attrition), system credibility support (trustworthiness, expertise, real-world feel), and social support (social learning, comparison, facilitation). Frontiers +2
Critical finding on human support: Meta-analysis shows apps with human support element produce larger effects than algorithm alone, with additive benefits when combining both. Frontiers +2 For someone with profound self-alienation and codependent patterns requiring relationship decision support, purely autonomous AI proves insufficient. Hybrid architecture with periodic human check-ins (weekly or biweekly) enables both scalable daily support and high-touch intervention when patterns suggest exploitation or dangerous relationship dynamics.
"Teaching while doing" versus separate modules—evidence decisively favors embedded learning. Wellrootscounseling A 2023 meta-analysis (Gulboy et al.) characterized embedded instruction as Evidence-Based Practice. ScienceDirect Definition: Multiple brief teaching interactions during everyday activities rather than separate settings or pull-out instruction. ScienceDirect Evidence base shows greater potential for generalization and maintenance versus pull-out models because skills are practiced in context of actual use, reducing need for artificial transfer activities. NCBIScienceDirect Job-embedded professional development research found 1:1 coaching support more effective than one-off training, with practice-based coaching showing greater impact than general best practices training. Torsh
Application to relationship management: Skills taught during actual relationship situations—communication coaching during conflicts, boundary-setting practice when partner makes request, financial decision support when money discussions occur—likely generalize better than standalone modules studied separately. This requires just-in-time intervention delivery triggered by user-initiated help-seeking ("I'm in a difficult conversation right now") or pattern recognition ("Your partner has made 5 financial requests in 3 days—let's review your boundaries"). No direct research validates this for relationship skills in apps specifically, but theoretical principles strongly suggest embedded > decontextualized.
Psychoeducation design for processing speed deficits and working memory issues:
Content delivery specifications: Short modules (10-15 minutes maximum per session), microlearning (3-7 minute video segments), multimodal presentation (video + text + interactive), concrete examples before abstract concepts, storytelling for narrative structure maintaining attention. ACM Digital Library +2 A Universal Design for Learning study (PMC 2023) showed significant improvements in basic learning skills for children with ADHD versus standard instruction when using multiple means of representation, multiple means of expression, and multiple means of engagement. NCBI
Cognitive Load Theory applications: Minimize extraneous load through information source integration (combine rather than separate), redundancy elimination (avoid unnecessary repetition), visual integration (incorporate labels into diagrams rather than separate), and modality effect (present information in both visual and auditory forms). eLearning Industry Critical: expertise reversal effect means what works for novices (detailed scaffolding) becomes distraction for experts. Virtual training challenges require balancing needs across mixed-ability audiences.
Performance over knowledge emphasis: Social skills training should focus on applying skills in context, not just learning about them. Research consistently shows psychoeducational behavioral interventions more effective when addressing performance deficits (how to apply skills) rather than knowledge deficits. Artificial clinic settings prove less effective than naturalistic practice. Integration into daily activities beats separate lesson completion. PubMed Central
Comprehensive life management architecture
True comprehensive "life operating systems" integrating health, relationships, finances, and academics remain absent from clinically validated literature. Corporate wellness platforms (BetterYou, Metta, Wellness360, Grokker) exist but lack clinical validation and therapeutic depth, focusing on wellness rather than intervention for profound life disruption. Mahalo +3 The critical question: Should the app present one task per day across all domains, or structured time blocks for different domains?
Evidence-based answer: Structured time blocks with adaptive prioritization. Threaded Cognition Theory from cognitive science shows humans can rapidly switch between goals (<1 second) but sustained focus requires 1.5-2 hour blocks. PLOS MoSCoW method from product management suggests 40% of capacity for must-haves, 30% for should-haves, remaining for could-haves. Parabol Research on competing life goals (Freund & Tomasik, 2021) found when multiple goals are equally important and time-constrained, prioritization may increase perceived goal conflict rather than resolve it. PubMed Central Prioritization works best when goals have clear differential importance.
Recommended daily architecture:
Morning (15 minutes): AI-generated daily priority ranking using RICE scoring—(Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort—across domains: health, relationships, finance, personal growth, career. Aloa System presents top 3-5 priorities for user review and adjustment. This "suggest-then-consent" model provides structure (competence support) while preserving autonomy (user has final say on all elements). Taylor & Francis Online
Time blocks (2-3 per day): Block 1 (1.5-2 hours): Highest priority domain. Block 2 (1.5-2 hours): Second priority domain. Block 3 (1 hour): Third priority domain OR flexible response to emerging needs. This structure balances 60% structured (must/should-haves) with 40% flexible response, preventing the rigidity of single-task-per-day while avoiding the chaos of unguided multitasking.
Micro-interventions (throughout day): JITAI-style prompts for skill practice and emotional support, triggered by context (stress detection, location changes, social situations). PubMed Central +2 Brief duration (2-5 minutes) not requiring deep engagement. These maintain therapeutic presence without disrupting focused work blocks.
Evening (10 minutes): Reflection and adaptation. What got done? Obstacles encountered? Adjust tomorrow's priorities based on outcomes. This learning loop enables system to increasingly predict effective priorities.
Adaptive elements ensure responsiveness: Crisis override (high-priority need in any domain triggers immediate notification), energy adaptation (low energy reports reduce scope/difficulty), success amplification (domains showing progress receive reinforcement), and neglect detection (domains untouched >3 days automatically surface). This prevents the single-task model's risk of neglecting important domains for extended periods while maintaining cognitive load management.
Adaptive AI versus predetermined pathways
The evidence decisively favors adaptive systems. Wellrootscounseling A 2020 meta-analysis (Wang & Miller, 33 studies) found JITAIs (Just-in-Time Adaptive Interventions) showed effect size g=0.89 versus non-JITAI treatments—a large effect. Compared to waitlist controls: g=1.65. Key moderators: tailoring to BOTH past patterns AND current states produces additive effects, and combining human agents WITH algorithms produces additive effects beyond either alone. Wiley Online Library +2
DIAMANTE study (2024, largest reinforcement learning validation): Adaptive RL group showed significant step count increase over 24 weeks versus random messaging control showing no significant change. Mechanism: RL personalizes message type and timing based on individual response patterns. JMIR The system learns which interventions work for this specific person in this specific context, continuously optimizing over time.
Implementation specifications: Use reinforcement learning for timing and frequency optimization, supervised learning for content personalization, and combine with rule-based eligibility criteria. Netguru Gupta et al. (2021) recommend two simultaneous RL models—intervention-selection for long-term patterns and opportune-moment-identification for momentary context. Wiley Online Library +3 Accelerator techniques include eligibility traces (rewarding past actions throughout trajectory) and transfer learning (reusing knowledge across users/domains).
When predetermined pathways make sense: Severe/complex conditions requiring clinical oversight. CBT+ for bulimia example: therapist approves each intervention. Meta-analytic finding confirms human + algorithm produces larger effects than algorithm alone. PubMed For trauma, self-alienation, and codependency, blend adaptive AI with human touchpoints rather than fully autonomous systems.
Hybrid "guided flexibility" architecture (RECOMMENDED): Macro structure follows evidence-based pathways (e.g., trauma recovery phases: safety → processing → integration). Micro adaptation uses AI to optimize timing, content, and difficulty within current phase. Human oversight occurs at transition points—clinician assesses readiness for next phase. Emergency override ensures AI detects crisis states and routes to human immediately, never relying on autonomous AI for severe deterioration.
Proactive versus reactive relationship management: Mental health app research shows proactive approaches more effective than reactive. Meta-regression (48 studies) found self-help interventions MORE effective in non-clinical settings (effect size 0.66) than clinical settings (effect size 0.22), suggesting prevention outperforms crisis response. Proactive mental health practices build resilience for handling challenges, with CBT particularly effective when provided before symptoms become unmanageable (typically 6-10 sessions sufficient when started early).
For relationship management specifically, implement hybrid approach: scheduled check-ins (weekly relationship reflection prompts), pattern-triggered interventions (system detects concerning patterns—frequent financial requests, communication pattern changes—and proactively offers support), user-initiated support (on-demand access when experiencing difficulties), and just-in-time coaching during actual situations when user explicitly requests. This balances autonomy (user control over engagement) with safety (system monitors for exploitation patterns and intervenes proactively when detected). Taylor & Francis OnlinePubMed Central
Identity reconstruction for profound self-alienation
Someone who "doesn't know himself" and experiences profound self-alienation requires specific therapeutic approaches rarely implemented in digital formats. CPTSD FoundationMe Too Therapy The research gap is significant—no validated digital interventions exist specifically for profound self-disconnection. However, theoretical frameworks and preliminary studies provide guidance.
Narrative identity framework (McAdams, 2018): Identity as story we tell about ourselves. Trauma disrupts narrative continuity. Reconstruction requires "re-authoring." George Fox University +2 Trauma creates contaminated identity (shame, self-loathing, sense of complicity), internal fragmentation (alienation from disowned parts of self), and relational disruption (difficulty trusting, connecting). CPTSD Foundation For someone who was elite performer (beatbox champion) experiencing identity collapse to current unemployed, bedridden state, the narrative discontinuity proves profound.
Phoenix Woman Framework (2025, trauma-informed model) identifies five stages: Recognition (naming abuse patterns), Grieving (processing loss of former self-concept), Reclaiming (re-establishing boundaries, rejecting shame narratives), Reconnection (building authentic relationships), Rise (integration of trauma into coherent, empowered identity). Lasupsj This provides structure for identity reconstruction work within app.
Digital prototype design for self-alienation:
Daily micro-practices: Morning: "What do I need today?" (open-ended, not multiple choice initially). Periodic throughout day: "What am I feeling right now?" using emotion wheel + body sensation mapping. Evening: "What did I want today?" for retrospective awareness building.
Progressive modules over 10 weeks: Weeks 1-2: Body awareness (sensations, needs recognition). Weeks 3-4: Emotion identification (expanding vocabulary beyond "good/bad/angry/sad"). Weeks 5-6: Preference discovery (likes, dislikes, values clarification). Weeks 7-8: Internal parts mapping (IFS-inspired identifying different "selves"). Weeks 9-10: Integration practices (connecting parts into coherent whole).
Critical success factors: Safety first with crisis resources and therapist notification protocols. Pacing controlled by user (can pause intensity). No "right answers"—exploration valued over accuracy. Human backup through periodic check-ins with trauma-informed clinician. The app asks questions but doesn't judge answers, building trust through consistent non-judgmental curiosity.
AI conversational agent specifications: Non-judgmental curiosity prompts ("I'm wondering what that sensation might be telling you"). Mirroring and validation ("It sounds like that was really difficult"). Gradual complexity (start with binary choices—"Are you feeling more tense or more relaxed?"—expanding to open-ended over time). Pattern identification across time ("I notice you often feel disconnected when talking about your relationship"). FrontiersPubMed Central This requires sophisticated natural language processing but preliminary evidence from compassion-focused EMI (EMIcompass study) shows 3-week interventions combining face-to-face guidance with daily app exercises reduced stress sensitivity and negative affect while increasing positive affect and self-compassion. JMIR Mental HealthPubMed Central
For someone who "needs the app to know him more than he knows himself": This requires longitudinal pattern detection the user can't perceive in the moment. Machine learning tracks: emotional patterns (when does mood typically shift?), activity-outcome connections (which activities consistently improve mood even when not initially motivated?), relationship patterns (what interactions precede emotional dysregulation?), physical-mental connections (how does sleep/activity/pain affect functioning?), values clarification through revealed preferences (says relationships matter but analysis shows spending 80% of time on work—surface discrepancy gently). The system provides mirror showing patterns invisible to user in moment, gradually building self-knowledge through external observation becoming internalized. PubMed Central
Crisis management and safety planning
Research identified significant evidence for specific validated approaches though gaps remain for complex presentations. CAMS-based interventions (Collaborative Assessment and Management of Suicidality) have strongest evidence—5 published RCTs support clinical efficacy. PubMed Central Jaspr Health tablet-based app for suicidal patients in emergency departments integrates CAMS with comprehensive suicide risk assessment, crisis stability plan building, lethal means counseling, behavioral skills training, and peer-lived experience videos. Pilot RCT (n=31) demonstrated feasibility with no adverse events and high acceptability. PubMed CentralJMIR Mental Health Patients could use during profound crisis, suggesting robust design.
Safety planning apps show preliminary promise. Beyond Now (Australia) used by 50,000+ people annually implements 7-step process based on Stanley & Brown's SPI. Pilot study found significant reductions in suicidal ideation and increases in suicide-related coping over 3 months. ScienceDirect SafePlan (Ireland) meta-analysis showed safety planning interventions reduce suicidal behavior with relative risk 0.570 (95% CI 0.408-0.795; NNT=55). PubMed Central However, 2024 systematic review of 14 peer-reviewed studies concluded: "Preliminary evidence shows apps may help mitigate suicide risk" but "clinical trials with larger sample sizes and more robust designs needed before widespread adoption."
Evidence-based crisis features validated: Direct crisis line access (988, text lines) has Level E1 evidence. Safety planning intervention following Stanley & Brown protocol shows RCT support with NNT=55. PubMed Central CAMS-based assessment has 5 published RCTs. JMIR Mental Health Peer-lived experience videos show emerging evidence. Behavioral skills training from DBT/CBT foundation.
Commonly included but weakly validated: Grounding exercises have clinical consensus but minimal app-specific research. A Place of HOPE Breathing exercises have physiological basis but not validated in app format for panic. Healthline +2 Mood tracking during crisis lacks evidence for acute intervention. Inspirational quotes/affirmations have no evidence base. General mindfulness shows evidence for prevention, not acute crisis management.
Missing features that should be included: Lethal means counseling is evidence-based but rarely in apps. PubMed Central Geolocation for emergency services represents underused technology capability. Collaborative planning with clinician is evidence-based but technically challenging. Real-time risk algorithms face ethical/safety concerns limiting implementation. Family/support person integration has evidence but privacy concerns complicate implementation.
For complex trauma presentation: Human routing protocols essential. Never rely on autonomous AI for severe states. Continuous risk monitoring through both passive sensors and active assessment. Immediate human routing for suicidal ideation, severe self-alienation (can't identify any needs), or complete task paralysis. Research shows deterioration rate of 6.7% (95% CI 4.3-10.1) in digital therapeutic trials, Nature similar to control groups, but this represents substantial absolute numbers requiring safety infrastructure.
Validated apps and protocols for similar presentations
The critical finding: NO apps exist validated for similar complex presentations. Comorbidity prevalence is high—31.1% of adults with mental disorders have co-occurring disorder (>15 million Americans), 80% lifetime comorbidity risk for PTSD, up to 80% lifetime depression risk with OCD. ScienceDirectPubMed Central Yet apps test single diagnoses with strict exclusion criteria. Real-world users are systematically excluded from trials.
FDA-cleared digital therapeutics with strongest evidence:
EndeavorRx (Akili Interactive, 2020) for ADHD: Only FDA-cleared prescription video game. EndeavorRx +3 STARS-ADHD trials show adults achieved +6.5 improvement (nearly 7x higher than children) in 6-week trial. 83% showed clinical improvements, 37% no longer exhibited attention deficit, 61% experienced clinically meaningful productivity improvements. ADDitudePsychology Today Multi-component cognitive training targeting attentional control through 25 minutes/day, 5 days/week protocol. EndeavorRx +3 Can be used alongside stimulant medications, addressing medication concerns your user expressed. Dtxalliancenature
DaylightRx (Big Health, 2024) for generalized anxiety: First FDA-cleared digital therapeutic for GAD. RCT (n=386) showed 70%+ remission rates with significantly reduced anxiety at 6 weeks. Delivers CBT (cognitive restructuring, applied relaxation, stimulus control) via smartphone. 90-day treatment program. Effect size d=1.08 versus waitlist. Psychiatry Advisor +3
Rejoyn (Otsuka, 2024) for major depressive disorder: First FDA-cleared app for MDD but critical limitation—primary outcome NOT statistically significant (p=0.0568). MADRS score improvement only 1.78 points versus sham control with questionable clinical significance. Psychiatric News +4 Experts questioned efficacy despite FDA clearance. Excluded treatment-refractory depression, bipolar, and high suicide risk—exactly the complexity your user presents. Psychiatry Advisor This illustrates FDA clearance doesn't guarantee strong efficacy or applicability to complex cases.
Freespira (2018) for panic attacks and PTSD: Mobile app with device measuring CO2 levels, detects panic attacks, implements relief protocol. 91% of patients Psychiatry Advisor reported significant symptom reductions in trials. PubMed Central +2 Relevant for social anxiety and agoraphobia components.
Key limitation across all validated apps: Effect sizes are small (typical NNT ~11-12 for depression/anxiety apps per meta-analysis of 176 RCTs). PubMed CentralPubMed Best as adjuncts to medication/therapy, not standalone treatments. For someone with severe functional impairment requiring comprehensive life support, validated apps provide pieces but not integrated whole.
Specific protocols with validation:
Behavioral Activation (Brief version, BATD-R): 10-session shortened format for severe cases. Daily monitoring schedule with simplified tracking. Focus: Life values → specific activities → barrier elimination. Effective for treatment-resistant depression. 2025 JMIR meta-analysis (17 RCTs) confirmed effectiveness at 2, 3, and 6 months but not 12 months, requiring sustained engagement strategies.
Graded Exposure for Kinesiophobia: Phase 1: Motivational interviewing. Phase 2: Pain neuroscience education. Phase 3: Graded exposure with fear hierarchy. 8-12 weeks typically required before aggressive reconditioning. Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia guides severity assessment and treatment planning.
Stepped Care 2.0 Protocol: Low-intensity (self-guided apps, psychoeducation) → Medium-intensity (coach-supported digital programs) → High-intensity (therapist-guided digital or face-to-face). 71% require intensity adjustment during treatment per RCT data. Measurement-based care with continuous outcome monitoring enables responsive adaptation.
What doesn't work: failed approaches and critical lessons
Rejoyn's primary outcome failure illustrates FDA clearance doesn't guarantee efficacy. Despite clearance for MDD, primary outcome missed statistical significance (p=0.0568) with mean difference only 1.78 MADRS points. Experts questioned clinical significance. Sham control possibly too active. Design excluded precisely the complexity most patients present—treatment-resistant depression, bipolar comorbidity, high suicide risk.
CopeSmart cluster RCT for adolescent mental health self-monitoring found primary hypothesis NOT supported—no increase in emotional self-awareness. Secondary hypotheses failed—no improvements in coping strategies, well-being, distress, or help-seeking. This contrasts earlier Mobiletype success with different population, highlighting generalizability challenges.
MONARCA for bipolar disorder showed no effect improving mental health outcomes versus controls despite mood monitoring capability. Participants already receiving psychopharmacology plus therapy suggested ceiling effect. Lesson: Adding digital to adequate existing treatment may not improve outcomes; digital therapeutics work best filling care gaps, not duplicating adequate care.
Multiple pragmatic RCTs during COVID-19 (n=838) of commercial apps found no differences between active apps and attention control. All groups improved (regression to mean). 4-week engagement insufficient for emotion dysregulation/suicidal behavior. Lesson: Short intervention periods inadequate for complex presentations. Your user's 6-year timeline of deconditioning and trauma requires sustained engagement measured in months-to-years, not weeks.
Systematic problems across field:
Dropout rates threaten validity. Meta-analytic averages show high attrition varying by study with larger studies showing higher dropout. Engagement after initial weeks declines dramatically—Moodivate dropped from 100% week 1 to 33% by week 12.
Only 2.7% of mental health apps in app stores provide direct evidence of effectiveness. 64% claim efficacy but only 14% include any supporting evidence. Scientific language appears in 48% but high-quality evidence remains rare. Most validated apps no longer available in app stores.
Methodological quality issues pervasive: Only 55 of 171 trials (32%) reported adverse events. High risk of bias in most trials. Small sample sizes. Inadequate blinding (digital placebos difficult to create). Weak control conditions. Publication bias strongly indicated.
What consistently fails: Apps without human support show lower engagement and efficacy. Single-purpose tools prove less comprehensive than multipurpose. Passive interventions (tracking alone) prove insufficient. One-size-fits-all approaches lack necessary personalization. Apps ignoring comorbidity don't reflect real-world users. Short intervention periods (4 weeks) prove inadequate. Lack of integration with existing care limits effectiveness. Poor engagement strategies prioritizing technical features over behavior change principles.
Panic disorder apps show negative effect size in meta-analysis. PTSD apps show very small effects (g=0.12). Apps for high-risk populations raise safety concerns with digital-only approaches. This underscores: For your user's complexity with suicidal ideation history, profound self-alienation, and multiple severe conditions, human oversight isn't optional—it's essential.
Design recommendations: building it right
Optimal architecture synthesis:
Use modular-within-integrated approach. Integrated backend infrastructure ensures data flows across domains with unified authentication, security, and clinical decision support. Modular frontend content delivery enables flexibility—user focuses on relevant skills while comprehensive framework remains available. This allows both addressing all issues simultaneously (your requirement #1) and managing cognitive load (avoiding overwhelm).
Implement Stepped Care 2.0 with hybrid adaptive AI. Begin with self-guided digital components (low-intensity). Add coaching support when user struggles or progress stalls (medium-intensity). Integrate therapist oversight for phase transitions, crisis management, and trauma processing (high-intensity). AI optimizes within current intensity level—personalizing timing, content selection, and difficulty. Human clinician makes intensity adjustment decisions based on comprehensive assessment including AI-surfaced patterns.
Daily structure: Structured time blocks, not single task. Morning: 15-minute AI-guided priority review across domains (health, relationships, finances, academics, personal growth) using RICE scoring. Present top 3-5; user reviews and adjusts. Time Block 1 (90-120 minutes): Highest priority domain with focused activity. Time Block 2 (90-120 minutes): Second priority domain. Time Block 3 (60 minutes): Third priority OR flexible response. Throughout day: JITAI micro-interventions (2-5 minutes) triggered by context for skill practice, emotional support, grounding. Evening: 10-minute reflection adjusting tomorrow's priorities based on outcomes.
Teaching through embedded learning, not separate modules. Psychoeducation about each condition occurs in context of addressing that condition. When depression behavioral activation prompts activity, brief explanation of reward system dysfunction and why activity matters precedes task. When relationship boundary decision required, just-in-time boundary-setting education and communication scripts delivered during actual situation. When panic symptoms detected, grounding techniques taught and practiced immediately, not in separate "learn grounding" module completed at arbitrary time. Research shows embedded instruction provides greater generalization and maintenance than pull-out models.
Relationship management as proactive pattern detection with user control. System continuously monitors (with explicit consent and transparency): frequency of partner financial requests, emotional tone in relationship discussions (if user logs these), user's decision patterns, mood correlation with relationship interactions. When concerning patterns detected—partner requested money 5 times in 3 days, user's mood drops consistently after partner calls, financial drain exceeding sustainable level—app proactively initiates: "I notice [pattern]. Let's review your boundaries and financial goals. Would you like to talk about this now or schedule for later?" User maintains control (can dismiss or postpone) but receives objective feedback impossible to perceive in moment when codependency clouds judgment.
For profound self-alienation: The mirror function. User can't know himself better than app until app shows patterns he can't perceive. Implement longitudinal tracking with pattern surfacing: "Over the past 3 weeks, you've rated mood highest after these activities [list], even when you initially reported low motivation. Your body has signaled [these sensations] before anxiety episodes. You express valuing relationships but analysis shows 80% of your time spent alone—let's explore this discrepancy." The system provides external observation gradually internalized. Weekly "Who am I?" reflection prompts reviewing patterns, progress in emotion identification, body awareness, preference discovery. Progressive modules (body awareness → emotion vocabulary → preference discovery → internal parts mapping → integration) scaffold identity reconstruction over months, not weeks.
Crisis management: Continuous monitoring with human routing. Passive monitoring: Activity level, sleep patterns, communication frequency, mood ratings, task completion rates. Active assessment: Weekly PHQ-9 and GAD-7, daily mood check-ins, specialized ADHD and PTSD symptom tracking. Risk algorithms: Detect suicidal ideation (direct statements or indirect indicators), severe self-alienation (inability to identify any needs/feelings across multiple prompts), complete task paralysis (no activities completed for 3+ days despite prompts), relationship crisis (indicators of acute abuse or exploitation). Automatic human routing: Crisis counselor connection for suicidal ideation, therapist notification for severe deterioration, suggested emergency services for acute safety concerns. Never purely autonomous AI for severe states.
Gamification for motivation in depression and ADHD: Implement dopamine-driven reward systems with immediate frequent rewards for every completion, variable ratio rewards (unpredictable bonuses), visual progress indicators, point systems with clear meaning, streaks/chains ("don't break the streak"), avatar growth reflecting personal investment. Avoid leaderboards (triggers shame), complex achievement trees (overwhelm), loss/punishment mechanics (discourage already struggling users), excessive notifications (decision fatigue), social comparison (anxiety). Evidence shows gamification improves engagement consistently but transfer effects are limited—gains in gamified tasks don't always transfer to real-world function. Design should target intrinsic motivation (mastery, autonomy, purpose) while providing external motivation initially, with goal of gradual internalization.
Direct answers to specific questions
Should app present ONE task per day across all domains, or structured time blocks? Structured time blocks with adaptive prioritization. Evidence: Threaded Cognition Theory shows humans can rapidly switch (<1 second) but sustained focus requires 1.5-2 hour blocks. MoSCoW suggests 40% must-haves, 30% should-haves, 30% could-haves. One task per day risks neglecting domains for extended periods. Recommended: 2-3 time blocks (90-120 minutes each) for top priorities, plus JITAI micro-interventions throughout day, plus flexible response time. This balances comprehensive coverage with cognitive load management.
Teaching while doing vs. separate learning modules? Teaching while doing. Evidence: 2023 meta-analysis characterized embedded instruction as Evidence-Based Practice with superior generalization and maintenance. Skills practiced in context of actual use reduce need for artificial transfer. Job-embedded professional development shows 1:1 coaching more effective than one-off training. Application: Deliver psychoeducation in context of addressing each condition—explain reward system dysfunction when prompting activity, teach boundary-setting during actual relationship decisions, practice grounding during detected panic symptoms. No separate "learn about depression" modules completed at arbitrary times.
How do successful apps balance structure with user autonomy? "Suggest-then-consent" model based on Self-Determination Theory. System provides structure (AI-generated priorities, time-blocked schedule, specific task suggestions, progress tracking) supporting competence. User has autonomy (reviews/adjusts all AI suggestions, can swap block order, "not today" option, multiple pathway options within domain). Evidence: Meta-analysis shows autonomous motivation predicts success while controlled motivation shows no effect or negative effect. Implementation: Scaffolding and fading—high structure initially (crisis states, early stages, severe symptoms), increasing autonomy as skills develop (user chooses from options, flexible scheduling), advanced self-direction with on-demand support.
AI-driven adaptive quest selection vs. predetermined pathways? Adaptive AI with human oversight. Evidence: Meta-analysis shows JITAIs produce effect size g=0.89 vs. non-JITAI treatments (large effect), g=1.65 vs. waitlist. DIAMANTE study confirmed RL personalizes effectively. However, human + algorithm produces LARGER effects than algorithm alone. Recommended: Hybrid guided flexibility—macro structure follows evidence-based pathways (trauma recovery phases: safety → processing → integration), micro adaptation uses AI optimizing timing/content/difficulty within phase, human oversight at transition points and crisis detection. Never purely autonomous AI for severe/complex conditions.
Should relationship management be proactive or reactive? Hybrid proactive-reactive. Evidence: Meta-regression (48 studies) found self-help interventions MORE effective in non-clinical settings (effect size 0.66) than clinical settings (0.22), suggesting prevention outperforms crisis response. Implementation: Scheduled check-ins (weekly relationship reflection), pattern-triggered interventions (system detects concerning patterns—frequent financial requests—and proactively offers support), user-initiated support (on-demand access), just-in-time coaching (during actual situations when requested). This balances autonomy with safety—user controls engagement but system monitors for exploitation patterns intervening proactively when detected.
How to integrate identity reconstruction? Longitudinal pattern detection providing mirror function. Daily micro-practices: Morning "What do I need today?", periodic "What am I feeling?", evening "What did I want today?" Progressive modules over 10 weeks: body awareness → emotion identification → preference discovery → internal parts mapping → integration. AI conversational agent provides non-judgmental curiosity, mirroring/validation, gradual complexity, pattern identification across time. System shows patterns user can't perceive: mood correlations with activities, body signals before anxiety, discrepancies between stated values and behavior. Evidence: Preliminary from compassion-focused EMI (EMIcompass) and narrative identity theory, though no validated apps exist specifically for profound self-alienation. This requires human backup through periodic trauma-informed clinician check-ins.
Critical limitations and validation needs
Major gap: No validated apps exist for this specific complex presentation. You're pioneering without direct precedent. Evidence synthesizes across domains—ADHD apps, depression apps, physical rehabilitation protocols, relationship theory, trauma frameworks—none tested together. Implementation risk requires careful evaluation and iteration.
Most digital therapeutic trials test 4-12 weeks. Your user's 6-year deconditioning requires sustained engagement measured in months-to-years. Evidence for long-term effectiveness (>12 months) is weak—2025 JMIR meta-analysis found behavioral activation showed no sustained benefits at 12 months despite effectiveness at 2, 3, and 6 months. Solution: Built-in evolution with initial intensive support transitioning to maintenance mode with responsive intensification when needed.
Effect sizes from validated apps are small (typical NNT 11-12 for depression/anxiety). Comprehensive life transformation for severely impaired user requires digital intervention as adjunct to human support, not replacement. Budget periodic therapist sessions (biweekly minimum, weekly during crisis) as integral architecture component, not optional add-on.
Passive mental state detection remains low accuracy. Can't reliably detect depression, anxiety, dissociation, or relationship stress from smartphone sensors alone. Requires hybrid with active EMA (user self-report) plus passive sensing, accepting limitations. Don't promise "knowing him" purely through sensors—that technology doesn't exist yet at required accuracy.
The user's specific needs—learning difficulties (struggles to read, write, understand), BDD focus (front teeth, voice), elite performer identity loss (beatbox champion)—require specialized accommodations. Reading struggles suggest heavy audio/video reliance with minimal text. Voice concerns suggest avoiding voice input initially. Identity loss from elite performance to current state requires specific narrative reconstruction from "champion" to integrated identity incorporating both past achievement and current struggles without shame.
Conclusion
Building this correctly requires accepting you're synthesizing validated components into novel architecture without direct precedent for full complexity. The strongest evidence supports: modular-within-integrated architecture, Stepped Care 2.0 framework, hybrid adaptive AI with human oversight, structured time blocks not single daily task, embedded learning not separate modules, proactive pattern detection with user control. For ADHD: single-task presentation, progressive disclosure, chunking under 1 hour, three-tier notifications, 15-minute sessions, working memory aids, 106-154 day habit formation timeline. For depression: micro-tasks starting with basics, 80-100% success rule, immediate mood tracking, values-based activation, external structure, simultaneous physical activation. For trauma/self-alienation: identity reconstruction through daily micro-practices, longitudinal pattern detection, narrative exercises, trauma-informed principles, human therapist oversight. For relationships: pattern detection with proactive surfacing, financial tracking with decision-support, embedded skill-building, just-in-time coaching.
The research provides clear roadmap while acknowledging significant validation work remains. Build incrementally, measure continuously, iterate based on outcomes, maintain human oversight throughout, and plan rigorous effectiveness studies from launch. The opportunity is substantial—comorbidity affects 31.1% of mental health populations but apps systematically exclude this complexity. Success requires combining validated components intelligently while remaining humble about unknowns and committed to ongoing evidence generation.
