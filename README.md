## 🎯 How It Works

1. **Open the app** each morning
2. **See your ONE quest** (e.g., "Stand for 10 seconds")
3. **Complete it** - it's impossibly simple
4. **Earn XP** and level up
5. **Come back tomorrow**

The app decides what you need. You just show up.

## 💡 Philosophy

### One Quest at a Time
Your brain is overwhelmed. ONE task per day is enough to start rebuilding.

### Impossible to Fail
Every quest is designed to be so simple you literally cannot fail.

### Temporary Exoskeleton
The app makes decisions for you now. As you rebuild, you'll need it less.

**The goal is for you to eventually delete this app because you don't need it anymore.**
